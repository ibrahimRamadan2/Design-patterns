# Stock Market Simulation with Real-time Updates

## Project Overview

Create a simulation of a stock market where stock prices are updated in real-time. Various entities such as traders, investment analysts, and news agencies (observers) will receive updates as soon as there are changes in stock prices. This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of the Observer Pattern in a scenario where multiple subscribers need to be notified about changes in the subject's stateâ€”in this case, the stock prices.

## Objectives

- Utilize the Observer Pattern to manage dynamic and real-time updates to stock prices.
- Showcase how the Observer Pattern can facilitate the development of applications requiring data synchronization across different subscribers.

## Implementation Details

### Define Subject and Observer Interfaces

- **StockMarket**: The subject that manages a collection of stocks and their prices.
- **Observer Interface**: Should include a method for updating the observers based on the changes in stock prices.

### Implement Concrete Observers

- **Trader**: Displays or reacts to real-time stock price changes.
- **InvestmentAnalyst**: Updates investment strategies based on the latest stock market trends.
- **NewsAgency**: Publishes news articles or alerts about significant stock market movements.

### Dynamic Interaction

- Ensure that observers can subscribe to and unsubscribe from the StockMarket dynamically, allowing them to start or stop receiving updates about stock price changes.

### Challenges

- **Selective Notification**: Implement functionality allowing observers to subscribe to updates for specific stocks only, rather than all market updates.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the notification mechanism to handle high-frequency updates efficiently, minimizing the delay in notifications.

## Expected Outcome

A stock market simulation system where stock prices are updated dynamically, and various observers receive notifications about these updates in real-time. This system will demonstrate the versatility and power of the Observer Pattern in handling real-time data distribution and observer management in a complex system.
